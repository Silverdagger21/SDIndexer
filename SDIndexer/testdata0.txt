Making The Grade is Diffuser's second album. It featured the band moving away from the hard rock style on "Injury Loves Melody" to more of a pop punk style similar to Sum 41. The songs "I Wonder" and "Get It On" were used in the 2003 movie Freaky Friday. The song "Get It On" and "New High" also appeared on the soundtracks for the Outlaw Volleyball and NHL Hitz Pro video games, respectively.

It was produced by Mark Trombino, who has worked with bands such as blink-182, Jimmy Eat World, Sugarcult, and Finch.
